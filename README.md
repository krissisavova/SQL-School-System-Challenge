# School System Challenge (Practice with SQL)

### This challenge is part of the LinkedIn Learning course "SQL for Testers." The idea of it is to work with a database consisting of 4 tables: classes, enrollments, roles and users. 

CHALLENGE 1: 
In this challenge, we have to answer the following questions:
1. Draw out the schema for this database?
2. What are the names of the students enrolled in the math class?
3. What classes is the person with username "ehorstead2" enrolled in?

CHALLENGE 2:
This challenge focuses on data modification:
1. Create a new class, enroll a new teacher and two new students in the class and then, chek the names of the students enrolled.
2. Change the role of the teacher enrolled in the Art class to be an administrator in that class.
